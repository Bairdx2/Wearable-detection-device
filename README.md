# Wrist-sensor-system

The wrist sensor system (WSS) is a highly portable and wearable device. WSS will give an individual the ability to screen patients for Covid-19, lung infections, diabetes. The device will contain many sensors with the intention of providing information regarding environmental and user physiological conditions. WSS will be integrated in a smart way to transmit and convey the information in an effective manner. The image below is of the first version of the wrist sensor system.

### Motivation:
The concept of the wrist sensor system came about because of apparent lacks Covid-19 testing. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test detects RNA associated with Covid-19 and is highly accurate but inconvenient due to the long wait turnaround times for results (1 day - 1 week). The antigen test (rapid test) detects proteins associated with Covid-19 and while not nearly as accurate as the PCR test, the turnaround times are remarkable slower (20 min - 1 day). The thought behind the wrist sensor system was to make a device that could not only give an decently accurate assesment in real time but also be highly portable and customizable.
